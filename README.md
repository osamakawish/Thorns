Basic data structures in C# convenient for many applications.

The package only contains trees, at the moment.

##### Behind the Name

The name **Thorns** is a reference to how the package is for *collections* in *C#*. The "sharp" from C# was taken to develop a notion of 
"collection of sharp objects", which thorns are a simple example of.
